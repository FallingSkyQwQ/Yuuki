# Yuuki Implementation Plan

## Stage 1: Project Structure and Core Infrastructure

**Goal**: Establish the foundational architecture with proper layering, dependency injection, database setup, and logging

**Success Criteria**:
- Solution compiles successfully with all layers ✅
- Dependency injection container is configured and functional ✅
- EF Core and SQLite database can be initialized ✅
- Logging system captures application events ✅
- Custom exception hierarchy implemented ✅

**Tests**:
- ✅ Solution compiles without errors
- ✅ All NuGet packages restored successfully
- ✅ Directory structure created for all layers
- ✅ ServiceProvider configures DI container
- ✅ DbContext configured for SQLite
- ✅ Serilog logging configured with file and console sinks
- ✅ Custom exception classes created

**Status**: Complete

### Tasks:
- [x] Check existing project structure
- [x] Create layered architecture directory structure
- [x] Configure dependency injection container and service registration
- [x] Set up Entity Framework Core and SQLite database
- [x] Configure logging system and error handling infrastructure

### Completed Components:
- Exception hierarchy: `YuukiException`, `AuthenticationException`, `DownloadException`, `LaunchException`
- Enum types: `ModLoaderType`, `ModPlatform`, `LaunchState`
- Data model: `GameInstance` entity
- `YuukiDbContext` with SQLite configuration
- `ServiceProvider` with DI, logging, and database initialization
- Updated `App.xaml.cs` with DI integration and global error handling
